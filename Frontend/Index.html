      <h2 class="animate-on-scroll">WHY SUKALYA?</h2>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">
        In rural India, healthcare challenges remain severe. Over 68% of the population lives in villages, yet many lack access to reliable health guidance. People often struggle due to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-container animate-on-scroll">
        <li><span>Language barriers</span> – Most resources are available only in English or Hindi, leaving many local dialect speakers excluded.</li>
        <li><span>Poor connectivity</span> – Rural areas suffer from weak internet access, making online apps unreliable.</li>
        <li><span>Overloaded helplines</span> – Government medical helplines face heavy call volumes, leading to delays.</li>
        <li><span>Low awareness</span> – Preventive healthcare practices and early disease detection are often neglected.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="animate-on-scroll">
        SUKALYA addresses these problems head-on by providing an AI-powered health assistant that works in local languages, via SMS/WhatsApp, with voice/text support, and is available 24/7.
